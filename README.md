# CritScreen
World Of Warcraft TBC 2.4.3 addon that takes a screenshot whenever you strike critically.

I wrote this addon for a friend a couple of years back and found it again just recently.
It would be a waste to delete it, so I'm publishing it here in the hope that it will help someone :)

## Usage

| Command | Description          |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| /cs | display the help/status text
| /critscreen | alias for /cs |
| /cs on\|off | turn CritScreen on/off
| /cs min &lt;value&gt; | set the minimum value to trigger a screenshot
